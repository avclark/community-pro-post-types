# Community Pro Post Types
The official custom post types for the Community Pro Genesis Child Theme by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/calvin_makes">Calvin Makes</a> and <a href="http:/www.twitter.com/avclark">Adam Clark</a>.


## Configuring Sermons
Sermons are a useful custom post type that allows you to fill in some details and have custom taxonomies for different series and/or categories.

1. Select **Sermons > Add New** from the WordPress Dashboard Menu.
2. Insert your Sermon Title
3. Add a description and/or transcript into the body content area.
4. On the right sidebar, navigate to the box that says **Sermon Details**.
5. Add in the **Speaker**, **Sermon Date**, and the **Souncloud URL** if your sermon is hosted on SoundCloud. Otherwise, leave it blank.
6. Configure the rest like a normal post or page in WordPress.
7. Click the **Publish** button.

## Configuring Staff
The Staff page is a way to organize staff information for your organization or church.

1. Select **Staff > Add New** from the WordPress Dashboard Menu.
2. Insert the Name of the Staff Member into the **Title Bar**.
3. Add a tagline for the staff member in the **Subtitle Bar** or leave blank.
4. Insert the staff member bio into the **Content Area**, along with a picture (this is how it's done on the theme demo).
5. On the right sidebar, navigate to the box that says **Staff Categories**, and add or select the appropriate category for the staff member.
6. Set a featured image, usually the same as the staff member's picture you inserted into the **Content Area**. (This is required for the Staff page template).
7. Click the **Publish** button.

Now that you know how to create individual staff members, you'll need to add a link to the Staff page template. By default, this is set to the */staff* slug in your URL.
For instance, if my domain is www.communityprotheme.com, then the Staff page will be located at www.communityprotheme.com**/staff**.

### Add Staff Link to Menu
1. Navigate to **Appearance > Menu**.
2. In your appropriate navigation menu, click the **Links** bar in the left sidebar.
3. Enter **/staff** into the URL input box.
4. Enter **Staff** into the Link Title input box, or something similar.
5. Click the **Add to Menu** button.
6. Save your Menu.

You should now see the link on your navigation.
